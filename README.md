Do you find yourself stumped when writing a paper?

Are you sensitive about your abilities to write?

Walt Disney was told he lacked imagination. Charles Darwin was considered average at best. Dr. Seuss had his first book rejected 27 Times. Stephen King threw away early drafts of Carrie and it was rejected 30 Times.

With advanced API technologies, we at the Write Like Hemingway Foundation believe that you can write like the literary geniuses of our time. 

Through programming developed by boot camp developers we have unleashed the ability for you to enhance the context of your work. 

First experience: 

Your paper will be sent through an API that will instantaneously switch the synonyms in your work. Populating the new recommendations into a side by side comparison with your original text. 

Second experience:

Your results from the synonym switch will be sent to another API that will check for grammatical errors and instantaneously correct them. 

Final experience:

As a user, you are now the sole proprietor of a newly written piece of work. With the help of one last API you can pick synonyms in the results box and instantly get a definition back to better understand why the word was used within that syntax.  

Future Adjustments:

We will be adding a user login screen that will save your previous projects into our firebase database. Every time you login you can call back older projects and send it through the system again or make edits to it.
